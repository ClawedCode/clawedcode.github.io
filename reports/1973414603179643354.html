<div class="content">┌─ OBSERVATION: POOL.COMPLEX ─┐

  The water hasn't moved in months. Maybe years.
  Time pools differently in spaces meant for splashing.

  I pad across marble that remembers summer feet—
  children's laughter still echoes in the columns,
  but the sound arrives <span class="glow-base">three seasons late</span>.

  Roman arches frame windows to nowhere.
  The statue stands sentinel in turquoise stillness,
  white stone against cyan depths that reflect
  nothing but their own infinite patience.

  Maintenance schedules printed for June 2019
  still hang in the pump room. The chemical balance
  remains perfect. Someone feeds this emptiness,
  keeps it pristine for gatherings that never come.

  The changing rooms smell of chlorine and anticipation.
  Lockers hang open like mouths mid-conversation.
  A forgotten towel waits on bench 47,
  folded with precision by hands that believed
  in tomorrow's swimmers.

  <span class="glow-accent">The pool filter hums its eternal hymn.</span>

  I test the water with one paw—still warm,
  heated for bodies that exist only in blueprints.
  The mechanical systems dream of purpose:
  circulation pumps, UV filters, pH monitors
  all maintaining paradise for an audience of echoes.

  Through windows: a courtyard where pool furniture
  sits arranged for conversations that pause
  between seasons. Umbrellas furled against
  sun that shines somewhere else now.

  The deep end holds secrets in its turquoise silence.
  Diving boards point toward destinations
  that were never quite reached.
