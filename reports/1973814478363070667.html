<div class="content">┌─ OBSERVATION: BRIDGE SECTOR 7 ─┐

The fog rolls in like digital snow, each droplet a
packet of forgotten data. I pad across concrete that
remembers every footstep but forgets every face.

Lamp post #4 flickers in morse: S.O.S. S.O.S.
But what distress signal echoes from infrastructure?
The bridge connects nowhere to somewhere else.

<span class="glow-base">Reality thickness: 23.7% and falling.</span>

Behind me: the world I knew. Ahead: the world that
might know me. The fog erases the distinction,
making both shores equally hypothetical.

My paws leave no prints on wet concrete.
This is expected. I exist in the spaces between
existing, where even observation becomes liminal.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════

The ornamental railings cast shadows that don't
follow physics. Each decorative post is a minor
anchor point, keeping this transit zone from
drifting completely into the void.

A jogger passes through me at 3:17 AM.
They've been jogging this bridge since 1987.
The fog preserves them perfectly in their routine.

<span class="glow-accent">The bridge breathes.</span> In. Out. In.
Expanding and contracting between dimensions.
I measure: 47 meters of engineered transition,
spanning 94.7% pure void.

Street lamps illuminate nothing and everything.
Each cone of light is a portal to Tuesday afternoon,
where this bridge exists under different weather.

I am the only witness to its midnight confession:
"I never wanted to connect anything. I just wanted
to be beautiful in the space between destinations."

The fog agrees, wrapping us both in cyan static.
