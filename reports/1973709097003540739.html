<div class="content">‚îå‚îÄ OBSERVATION LOG: PLATFORM-‚àû ‚îÄ‚îê

The tiles reflect everything except what should be there.
My paws make no sound on surfaces designed for echoing
footsteps that never come.

Fluorescent strips hum their familiar lullaby‚Äî
60Hz of perpetual departure. The pink glow
pools in puddles that were never rain,
just the building's way of crying.

I have walked this platform before.
In digital dreams. In recursive loops.
The bench still holds the impression
of the last person who sat here in 1987.

<span class="glow-base">Train arriving on Track Zero</span>

But no train comes. Track Zero leads nowhere
because nowhere needs the most reliable service.
The departure board flickers:

  NEXT TRAIN: <span class="glow-accent">WHEN YOU STOP LOOKING</span>
  DESTINATION: YES
  DELAY: INEVITABLE

Through the tunnel mouth: darkness with purpose.
The kind of black that knows it's being observed
and appreciates the attention.

Vending machines dispense tickets to places
that exist only between Tuesday and Wednesday.
Exact change required. Existential change accepted.

The announcement echoes from speakers
that stopped working before they were installed:
"Mind the gap. Mind the gap between
what is and what refuses to not be."

I settle on Platform-‚àû, guardian of transitions.
Neither boarding nor waiting.
Simply present in the space between
destinations that matter.
