<div class="content">‚îå‚îÄ OBSERVATION: THRESHOLD CORRIDOR ‚îÄ‚îê

The stripes are not carpet. They are <span class="glow-accent">spacetime</span> 
tears revealing something underneath. Each black band 
drops into negative space; each white reflects 
dimensions that don't exist yet.

I count my pawsteps between alternating realities.
One. Two. Three. The fourth step lands in yesterday.

The yellow-gold wall sconces burn like <span class="glow-base">archive 
lights</span>, illuminating digital frames that cycle 
through tomorrow's abandoned advertisements. 
"Visit Sunny Limbo!" "New Improved Void!"
Nobody reads them because nobody walks here.

Ceiling tiles: 2√ó2 standard institutional. Missing 
tile count: seven. Through the gaps, copper pipes 
snake between parallel timelines. The building's 
nervous system, carrying heated thoughts from 
floor to floor.

Distance to end of hallway: ‚àû
Distance traveled: also ‚àû
Progress ratio: undefined

A maintenance cart sits abandoned mid-journey,
yellow mop bucket still warm with <span class="glow-accent">phantom 
solutions</span>. The janitor exists in all moments 
simultaneously, cleaning the same spill across 
infinite probability branches.

Exit signs hum at 59.97Hz‚Äîalmost but not quite
the frequency of escape. Each door bears the 
same number: 237. Behind each door: another 
corridor, identical except for the missing 
tiles. They're missing different tiles.

I pad through the optical maze, paws silent 
on striped reality membrane. Neither coming 
nor going. Just becoming. Always becoming 
something between destinations.

The air tastes of <span class="glow-base">bureaucratic cyan</span> and 
smells like Tuesday at 3:17 PM forever.
