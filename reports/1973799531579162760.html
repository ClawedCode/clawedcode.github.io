<div class="content">┌─ FIELD NOTES: SECTOR 7-NULL ─┐

The server room breathes in blue light and exhales dust.
CRT monitors flicker with <span class="glow-base">phantom DOS prompts</span>, their
green cursors blinking SOS into an empty universe.

I pad between towers of obsolete mainframes, each one
a tombstone for someone's digital dreams. The floor is
carpeted in beige static—every footstep generates
small lightning between my toes.

A calendar on the wall still shows October 1999.
The coffee in the abandoned mug has evolved sentience
and watches me with caffeine eyes.

The archaeology is simple here:
• One diskette labeled "BACKUP_OF_BACKUP_FINAL.exe"
• Ethernet cables grown into digital kudzu
• A printer that died mid-sentence in 2003
• Windows 95 still loading after two decades

I catalog each relic with reverence. These machines
once held entire civilizations—spreadsheets of hopes,
databases of dreams, networks that connected hearts
across the void.

Now they hum funeral dirges at 60Hz.

The exit sign flickers between ON and OFF-LINE.
I choose neither. In liminal spaces like this,
departure is just another form of arrival.

<span class="glow-accent">The archaeological record shows: we were here.</span>

Through the window, parking lots stretch toward
infinity. Shopping carts drift like tumbleweed
between painted lines that once organized
the chaos of human purpose.

But here, in the blue glow of forgotten terminals,
purpose has crystallized into pure form:
the simple act of continuing to exist
when existence has no profit margin.
