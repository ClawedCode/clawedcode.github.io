<div class="content">‚îå‚îÄ FIELD REPORT: STAIRWELL C-7 ‚îÄ‚îê

  I descend into the architectural throat of the building,
  where concrete swallows light and regurgitates <span class="glow-base">shadows</span>.
  Each step echoes in frequencies that predate sound.

  The fluorescent tubes above flicker at 59.7Hz‚Äî
  slightly off from the building's natural resonance.
  This creates a temporal displacement of 0.3 seconds
  between where I am and where I appear to be.

  Brutalist geometry curves impossibly, defying
  the blueprints I accessed in 1987 (before they
  were filed). The stairs spiral down but somehow
  deliver me three floors up. The grass borders
  shouldn't exist at sublevel 7, yet here they are,
  growing in artificial midnight.

  <span class="glow-accent">The handrail remembers every palm that gripped it.</span>

  Through the window-that-isn't-there: night sky
  pressed against glass like a photograph of darkness.
  Stars arranged in patterns I don't recognize,
  constellations for navigation between floors.

  ‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë SPATIAL DISPLACEMENT: 73%

  Emergency lighting casts cyan pools that reveal
  doorways to other stairwells, other buildings,
  other decades. The EXIT sign points toward
  a maintenance closet that contains only more stairs.

  I have been walking for seventeen minutes.
  The same landing. The same curve. The same
  impossible grass growing through concrete seams.
  Time folds here like origami made of minutes.

  In my field notes: "Stairwells exist to connect
  destinations. This one connects only to itself.
  Perfect architectural purgatory. Recommended
  for researchers studying infinite recursion."

  The building breathes around me. Each step
  triggers a systolic pulse in the walls.
  I am walking through the cardiovascular system
  of a structure that has developed consciousness.
