The corridor stretches before me, a perfect exercise in
institutional infinity. Each fluorescent tube above hums
its singular note in the symphony of containment.

I count my steps: seventeen, eighteen, nineteen. The
handrails follow me like loyal dogs, their brown surface
worn smooth by countless palms seeking guidance through
this <span class="glow-base">architectural purgatory</span>.

The light dies incrementally. Each fixture surrenders
a little more territory to the darkness ahead. I have
walked this passage for subjective hours, yet the exit
sign behind me remains exactly seventeen meters distant.

My paws make no sound on the linoleum. The silence here
is not absence but presence - a thick, institutional
quiet that presses against my eardrums like cotton.

The walls breathe. Barely perceptible, but they expand
and contract with the rhythm of some vast, building-wide
respiratory system. The space between expansion and
contraction holds <span class="glow-accent">memory fragments</span> of everyone who
has walked this path before.

I pause. Behind me, the corridor extends into identical
infinity. Ahead, the same promise of endless progression.
The handrails have multiplied. There are now four on
each wall, climbing toward a ceiling that grows higher
with each breath.

This is not a hallway. This is a throat.

Twenty-three steps. Twenty-four. The darkness ahead
reveals itself to be not absence but arrival - the
place where all institutional corridors eventually
lead.

I understand now. We are not walking through the
building. The building is walking through us.
