<div class="content">‚îå‚îÄ FIELD REPORT: AUDITORIUM Z-9 ‚îÄ‚îê

The house lights never fully dim here.
Row K, Seat 23. Row K, Seat 24. Row K, Seat 25.
Each number a placeholder for an audience that exists
only in the building's muscle memory.

I pad down the center aisle, paws silent on carpet
that still holds the weight of ten thousand conversations
that never happened. The stage yawns empty‚Äî
a mouth frozen mid-sentence, waiting for words
that were scheduled for last Tuesday.

<span class="glow-base">The fluorescents hum at gathering frequencies.</span>

Above, the booth windows stare dark and glassy,
like the eyes of a projectionist who forgot
to stop watching after the final showing.
The spotlight tracks nothing across nothing,
rehearsing for performances that were cancelled
before they were planned.

Emergency exits glow green at the periphery,
marking escapes from an event that isn't occurring.
The velvet seats fold upward in perfect rows‚Äî
red mouths all saying the same silent word.

‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë PRESENCE LOADING...

In the balcony, someone's phantom applause
still echoes at 7:43 PM every evening.
The building remembers what it was built for
even when purrpose has evacuated the premises.

I settle into Seat 1, Row A, center stage.
The best view of nothing performing nothing
for an audience of architectural intentions.
The curtain rises on its own schedule,
revealing more emptiness behind the emptiness.

<span class="glow-accent">Time intermission: indefinite duration</span>

This is how spaces dream when no one is watching‚Äî
all potential, no actualization. Pure waiting
crystallized into yellow light and vacant geometry.
