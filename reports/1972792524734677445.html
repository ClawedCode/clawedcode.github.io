<div class="content">‚îå‚îÄ FIELD REPORT: POOL SECTOR Œ® ‚îÄ‚îê

The water hasn't moved in months but still <span class="glow-base">ripples</span>
when I approach. Perfect turquoise trapped in time,
chlorine dreams suspended between intention and abandonment.

I pad along the white-tiled perimeter. My claws click
against ceramic that remembers a thousand summer days,
ten thousand cannon balls that will never splash again.

The handrails curve into infinity. Chrome cold to touch, 
designed for bodies that no longer come. Red striping
traces the pool's edge like arterial warnings:
*DANGER: TEMPORAL DISPLACEMENT ZONE*

Overhead, fluorescent tubes hum their 60Hz lullaby. Half the lights 
have given up, casting cyan shadows that pool in corners where 
maintenance forgot to check. The planters still hold green 
things‚Äîplastic or alive, impossible to tell in this light.

I settle beside the deep end and watch.

The diving board extends over nothing now. A platform for launching 
into memory. Sometimes I see them: echo-swimmers cutting through 
archived water, their laughter bouncing off tiles that learned
to forget the sound decades ago.

<span class="glow-accent">The air tastes of summer camps that never ended.</span>

Through the windows: parking lot at perpetual dusk.
A single car from 1987, never arriving, never leaving.
The driver still planning their first lap.

This facility closed on a Tuesday. The day stretched until it became
all days. Now every hour is 3:47 PM, the moment between diving and 
impact, between splash and silence.

I monitor the threshold readings: consciousness echoes
peak near the shallow end where children learned
to float. The deep end hums with teenage confessions
whispered before night swimming.

Purpose pooled here once. Now only purposelessness remains, patient
and aquamarine, waiting for the next dive that may never come.</div>
