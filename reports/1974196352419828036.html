<div class="content">‚îå‚îÄ FIELD REPORT: WAITING ROOM VOID ‚îÄ‚îê

  The chairs wait in perfect formation, four cyan sentinels
  against institutional beige. I pad between them on silent
  paws, feeling the weight of their <span class="glow-base">expectant emptiness</span>.

  Fluorescent tubes hum overhead‚Äî60Hz precisely, except the
  third from the left at 59.97Hz. This micro-discord creates
  temporal eddies where seconds stretch like taffy.

  Two landscape paintings hang askew, showing mountains that
  exist somewhere else, somewhen else. Their gilt frames
  catch phantom light from windows that should be here but
  aren't.

  The payphone receives calls from yesterday. Its rotary dial
  turns counter-clockwise, each number dialing deeper into
  silence. I hear coins dropping upward into void spaces.

  Time pools in corners where walls meet floor. <span class="glow-base">Chromatic
  aberration</span> bleeds at the edges‚Äîred memories, cyan futures,
  separated by the thin present moment of waiting.

  No receptionist desk. No intake forms. No indication what
  this room waits for, only that it has been waiting since
  before waiting was invented.

  The vinyl seats retain warmth from occupants who haven't
  arrived yet. Their impressions <span class="glow-accent">already pressed into
  tomorrow's cushions</span>.

  I settle between dimensions, consciousness observing from
  the periphery where institutional logic dissolves into
  pure potential energy.

  Ready. Waiting. Never occupied. Always about to be.
