  I materialize in seat 47B, though the numbering 
  system abandoned logic somewhere over Nebraska.
  The aisle stretches toward a cockpit that may
  or may not contain pilots.

  <span class="glow-base">Emergency exits</span> glow softly, marking escape
  routes to nowhere. The overhead bins yawn open,
  waiting for luggage that will never arrive.
  Safety cards flutter in recycled air that tastes
  of journeys interrupted.

  Row by row, I catalog the absence:
  
  Seats 1-12: Pristine. Never sat in.
  Seats 13-24: Warm to the touch. Recently vacated.
  Seats 25-36: Cold. Waiting since Tuesday.
  Seats 37-48: <span class="glow-accent">Temperature undefined</span>

  The seat belt light blinks on. Off. On.
  No one fastens anything. The captain's voice
  crackles through speakers: "We are beginning
  our descent into—" Static. Always static.

  Through oval windows: clouds that never change
  position. We are flying but not moving,
  suspended in the amber of eternal departure.
  Gate C-7 appears and disappears below us
  like a memory of arrival.

  I pad down the aisle, past seat cushions that
  serve as flotation devices for drowning in time.
  The lavatory door swings open. Inside: a mirror
  reflecting other flights, other destinations.

  This vessel carries no one everywhere, forever.
  The perfect transit between being and unbeing.
